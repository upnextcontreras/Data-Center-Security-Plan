## 📘 Project Overview

This project outlines a comprehensive **Data Center Security Plan** for a made-up College, addressing the urgent need to secure the business and research data centers under space and budget constraints. The plan is developed in response to potential security breaches and is structured around the **three core pillars of cybersecurity**:

- **Administrative Controls**
- **Technical Controls**
- **Physical Controls**

Each control type includes policies, procedures, and technology integrations aligned with NIST and ISO standards to minimize risks and protect sensitive institutional data.

### 💻 Technical Controls

These enforce cybersecurity measures that protect the network and system infrastructure from external and internal cyber threats.

- **Firewall Configuration**
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDPS)**
- **TLS/SSL Encryption**
- **Network Access Control**
- **Virtual LAN (VLAN)**
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Patch Management**
- **Audit Logging**

### 🏢 Physical Controls

These aim to prevent unauthorized physical access and protect infrastructure integrity.

- **Security Guards**
- **CCTV Monitoring**
- **Biometric (Facial Scanner) Entry**
- **Badge Swipe Access**
- **Entrance Logging**

**Other Measures:**
- Bollards to prevent vehicle intrusion
- Motion Sensors
- Environmental Controls (smoke/temperature detectors)
