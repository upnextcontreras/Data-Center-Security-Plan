## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project outlines a comprehensive **Data Center Security Plan** for ACME College, addressing the urgent need to secure both the business and research data centers under space and budget constraints. The plan is developed in response to potential security breaches and is structured around the **three core pillars of cybersecurity**:

- **Administrative Controls**
- **Technical Controls**
- **Physical Controls**

Each control type includes policies, procedures, and technology integrations aligned with NIST and ISO standards to minimize risks and ensure the protection of sensitive institutional data.
